When you have dozens of deployable projects in a single repository, traditional one-workflow-per-project approaches hit concurrency limits fast. Here's how to solve it.

## The Challenge

Large monorepos with many independently deployable services need independent versioning, security scanning, and multi-environment deployments - without drowning in workflow files.

## The Approach

Dynamic workspace discovery with matrix strategies, artifact-based plan passing, and per-component release automation.

## Key Decisions

- **Single workflow with dynamic discovery** over per-project workflows to avoid concurrency limits
- **Per-component semantic versioning** for independent release cadence
- **GitOps deployment state** tracked declaratively
- **Triple security scanning**: policy compliance, vulnerability scanning, and custom rules

More details coming soon.
