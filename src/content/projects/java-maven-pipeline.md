## Overview

Built a reusable CI/CD pipeline for Java Maven microservices, covering build, test, containerize, scan, and deploy to Kubernetes.

## Technical Highlights

- Maven build with dependency caching and parallel test execution
- Container image builds with multi-stage Dockerfiles
- SonarQube quality gates integrated into PR checks
- Trivy container image scanning before registry push
- Helm-based deployments to Kubernetes with environment promotion
- Artifact versioning tied to Git tags and Maven release plugin
